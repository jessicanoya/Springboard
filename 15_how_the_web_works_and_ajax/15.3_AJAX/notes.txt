Getting axios:
Can easily include it using a CDN link:
<script src="https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.js"></script>

To make a request with axios:
axios.get(url) - completes before the response is received
async - used in functions e.g.:
    - async function getDat() {}
await - keyword that will wait for a response e.g.:
    - const res = await axios.get('https://api.spacexdata.com/v3/launches/upcoming');
axios does not have a way to handle errors. This would have to be implemented with try/catch block.

AJAX is asynchronous: 
This means it does not block the execution of other scripts or the user interface of the web page.
1. The JavaScript code sends a request to the server
2. Instead of waiting for the response, the browser continues to execute the scripts and update the user interface.
3. When the server eventually responds, a callback function is triggered to handle the response.

In traditional synchronous requests, the browser halts all other activities while waiting for a response from the server.
