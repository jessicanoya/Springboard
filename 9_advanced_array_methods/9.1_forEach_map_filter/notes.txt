What is a callback?
A function that gets executed after another function has finished execution

forEach
1. Loops through an array
2. Runs a callback function for each value in the array and then returns undefined
3. foEach will always return undefine no matter what

map
1. Creates a empty new array
2. Iterates through an array
3. Runs a callback function for each value in the array
4. Adds the result of that callback function to the new array
5. Returns the new array
6. map always returns a new array of the same length
7. If no 'return' is specified, map will return undefined

When would you use map
1. You want to transform an arry into another array of the same length
2. You do not want to overwrite an existing array and instead return a new copy

filter
1. Creates a new array
2. Loops through an array
3. Runs a callback function on each value in the array
4. If the callback function returns true, that value is pushed to the new array
5. If the callback function returns false, the value will not be inclued in the new array
