Data Structures in JavaScript
- Data structures are formats for efficiently collecting or storing data
- Arrays and objects
- ES2015 introduced two new ones, Maps and Sets

Maps
- Also called "hash maps" in other languages
- Until ES2015 - objects were replacements for maps
- Everything is a key/value pair in a map except keys can be ANY data type
- A literal syntax for maps does not exist, instead this is how you would do it:
    i. new Map() - have to use the 'new' keyword
- To add a key/value pair, use method called set(key, value)
- To retrieve key value use .get(key) method
- Retain order unlike Objects
- Objects are not iterables

Sets
- Only store unique values
- Any type of value can exist in a set
- Must be created with the 'new' keyword
    i. new Set()

When would you use sets?
- Removing duplicate values
- Uniqueness required
- Efficiently checking if an item is in a collection (better than arrays)

When would you use Maps?
- Finding the size is easy - no more loops or Object.keys()
- The keys can be any data type
