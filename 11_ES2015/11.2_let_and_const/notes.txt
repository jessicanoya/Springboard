var
- The var keywork is used to declare variables
- It used to be the only way to declare a variable
- When defined in a function, the var keywork scopes a variable to that function

let 
- It can be reassingned but not redeclared (unlike var)
    * SyntaxError: Identifier '<someVariable>' has already been declared
- The let keyword creates a block-scoped variable: a variable that only exists inside a code block

What is a code block?
Anything inside curly braces (outside of object syntax)
let and const are scoped to the code block
{
    // This is a code block
    let x = 5;
    var y = 10;
}

console.log(x);
// ReferenceError: x is not defined

console.log(y);
// 10 

const
- The const keyword prevents a variable from ever being reassigned or redeclared
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 15; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
const pi = 5; // SyntaxError
- const stands for constant, a value that is not supposed to change
- const is also block scoped, like let
{
    const x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
