## **Part I**

Answer the following questions:

- What ***git*** command creates a branch? 
  git branch <name> or git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
  
- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
  fast-foward merge commits happened in a chronological order
  recursive merge commits did not happen in a chronological order
  
- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
  git checkout
  
- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
  git branch -d <name_of_branch>

- How do merge conflicts happen?
  When people make changes to the same line of the same file under different branches and then try to merge them

## **Part II**

Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches.
